#Meetup 2 Eatup 

5/15/2016
The database is on Heroku (Thanks Mauricio) and I have the server pulling my HTML. 
I changed the home page up a bit, adding the login and signup to a navbar header. Each page will have a header where we can include quick links.

Added API routes to /api/:id?

/api returns all members in the table as json.

/api/2 will return member 2 as json.

Home Nav Links - "Meet Eaters" links to /questions. "Sign Up" links to /signup.

I also have a page for custom css, at /css.
